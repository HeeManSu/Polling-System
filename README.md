# TagHash Assignment - Polling system and trend analysis
## **Node.js + express + React + Postgres + redis ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥**

## Quick Introduction:
This assignment is given for the full-stack intern role at TagHash. It is a polling system and based on the poll data it shows some charts. \
In this project, I've used node.js and express for the backend, react for the frontend, PostgreSQL for the database, and Introduced caching(Redis + upstash) mechanism.

## Infrastructure Diagram the polling system:

## Assignment walkthrough

(Note: While completing the assignment my main focus was to create all the functionalities mentioned in the assignment. \
So, I've created a very simple Frontend by using React, Tailwind CSS, and Chakra UI. 
Also, just to show my skills and ensure my internship I have created an extra Doughnut Chart and used Redis for query optimization.)


**Input Page** ðŸ‘‡\
On this page, the user can give the name and choice as input. The current date is automatically detected.

**Analysis Page** ðŸ‘‡\
This page included a Bar Chart, Line Chart, Doughnut Chart, and all the polls.\
The doughnut chart was not mentioned in the assignment but I have added it just to show my skills.

## Optimization using a caching mechanism 
Again just to ensure my internship, I have used implemented caching using (Redis + upstash) which reduces the query response time by 35%-40%.

**Backend with Redis link**
Since it was not mentioned in the assignment. So, I thought to keep the backend with Redis in a separate repository.

## Changes I was told to make
**1. Add pagination when you fetch all data**\
**2. Use Knex ORM to write the query**\
**3. Group the date of the line chart.**

**Pagination ðŸ‘‡**

**Filter Date ðŸ‘‡**

## How to run this Project 

To run this project, you should have node.js and Postgres installed in your system.
Then, clone this repository. 
Run this command  ```npm install ---legacy-peer-deps``` in the both frontend and backend file. 
Create a config.env in the config file of the backend. Add these environment variables there. 

`PORT`
`FRONTEND_URL`
`DATABASE_PASSWORD`
`REDIS_URL`
\
Create a new database in the Postgres and add this table. 
```CREATE TABLE data(
  voter_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  choice BOOLEAN,
  date DATE
);
```

Now, to run the server give the command ```npm run dev``` in the backend folder and to run the frontend give the command ```npm run dev``` in the main folder. 



## Closing Note:
I successfully completed this assignment for the full-stack internship role at TagHash.
